        <h2>Sentiment Analysis On Women's Clothing Reviews</h2><br>
        <h3>ABSTRACT</h3><br>
        <p>
            In the realm of education and literature, electronic commerce (e-commerce) is a prominent field of study.
            While much research has focused on e-commerce in developing economies, there's a growing interest in
            understanding customer behavior as they transition from traditional retail shopping to online platforms.
            This project employs sentiment analysis on customer reviews within the e-commerce domain, utilizing Natural
            Language Processing (NLP) techniques to discern broad trends in customer sentiments. The primary objective
            is to predict whether customers recommend the products they purchased based on their review texts.
            Challenges include extracting pertinent information from review texts and converting them into numerical
            vectors for machine learning algorithms. <br>
        </p>
        <h3>PROJECT TITLE & OBJECTIVE</h3><br>
        <p>
            The project, titled "SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON WOMEN'S CLOTHES REVIEWS" under the category of E-commerce, aims
            to utilize NLP techniques to discern trends in customer sentiments. The objective is to predict customer
            recommendations using machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques. <br>
        </p>

        <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3><br>
        <p>
            Challenges include extracting relevant information from review texts and implementing supervised ML
            classification algorithms and Deep Learning on RNN with Gated Recurrent Unit. <br>
        </p>

        <h3>PROJECT SIGNIFICANCE</h3><br>
        <p>
            In today's educational and commercial landscape, e-commerce is a vital area of study. As online shopping
            becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding customer sentiments through sentiment analysis becomes
            crucial. This project addresses the need to evaluate effective techniques for sentiment analysis within the
            e-commerce domain. <br>

        </p>

        <h3>PROJECT FOCUS</h3><br>
        <p>
            The project seeks to predict whether customers, particularly women, recommend products based on their review
            texts. Emphasis is placed on utilizing only the "Review Text" variable for analysis. The dataset comprises
            22,641 rows and 10 variables, each representing a customer review with various attributes. <br>
        </p>

        <h3>DATASET DESCRIPTION</h3><br>
        <p>
            The dataset includes 23,486 rows and 10 feature variables, such as Clothing ID, Age, Title, Review Text,
            Rating, Recommended IND, Positive Feedback Count, Division Name, Department Name, and Class Name. <br>
        </p>

        <h3>ANALYTICS TOOLS</h3><br>
        <p>
            Python Notebook (Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab) <br>
        </p>

        <h3>ANALYTICS APPROACH</h3><br>
        <p>
            Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest
            Classifier (RF), Ada Boost
            Deep Learning Algorithm: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). <br>
        </p>

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3><br>
        <p>
            The project utilizes sentiment analysis to determine product recommendations. Various machine learning and
            deep learning algorithms are employed, with Ada Boosting, Naive Bayes, Deep Learning, SVM, and Logistic
            Regression showing promising results. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific dataset and
            requirements, each having its own strengths and weaknesses. <br>
